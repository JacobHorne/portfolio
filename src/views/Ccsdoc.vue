					<h1>DISCOVERY</h1>
					<div>
						<h3>Describe the company and the service it provides</h3>
						<p>Think of GROK as an “unconference” - “a small-batch event.” GROK is unlike most conferences in a number of great ways. Most conferences focus on providing headline speakers to bring in a crowd. The crowd is usually separated from the presenters by a stage and dark lighting that doesn't allow the presenter and the crowd to interact. GROK doesn't run this way.
						to each other in small groups.</p>	
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Who is the target audience for the site?  What information/content is the audience looking for?</h3>
						<p>The primary audience for GROK are creative professionals: designers, developers, musicians, artists, writers, etc., who are looking for an alternative to other large-scale events that feature well-known presenters in lecture or workshop formats, and instead prefer a small event where they can develop relationships and real conversations with other professionals.</p>
					</div>

				<section class="col2 clearfix">
					<div>
						<h3>What are the company’s primary goals/objectives?</h3>
						<p>The website for GROK seeks to drive event registrations by quickly and clearly explaining the concept of the event, what makes it unique from other “web” conferences, and what attendees can expect to take away from the event.</p>
					</div>
				
					<div>
						<h3>Describe the Company’s Brand, Personality, and Culture</h3>
						<p>The brand for GROK is that of an “un-conference.” Fun, quirky, personable, and doesn’t take itself too seriously, yet possesses a level of professionalism and quality that sets it apart from other events. Event swag, signage, and other materials are cleanly, professionally designed, and show an appreciation to detail. Word-of-mouth about this event is positive and strong, and most previous attendees highly recommend the event to others.</p>
